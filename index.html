            <h2>Mission #2</h2>
            <p>
                As you explore the Red Fort, you notice a faint aroma wafting through the air. It's a delicious smell that reminds you of something familiar, something you've tasted before. You follow the scent to a hidden corner of the fort, where you find a piece of paper with a recipe written on it.
                <br/>
                The recipe is for a popular street food that's famous in Old Delhi. It's a type of stuffed bread that's fried to crispy perfection and served with chutney and pickles. The recipe calls for flour, spices, and a filling made from vegetables, paneer, or meat.
                <br/>
                As you read the recipe, you notice that some of the ingredients are written in a different colour or font. When you write them down, they spell out a secret message:
                <br/>
                "Find me in the narrow alley, where paranthas are the star,
                <br/>
                And spices fill the air with a fragrance that travels far."
                <br/>
                Where should you to go to find next clue?

                The rival merchant's shop is where the missing spice merchant's trail went cold. But we suspect foul play! We have reason to believe that something valuable was stolen from the spice merchant's shop and taken to the rival's den.
