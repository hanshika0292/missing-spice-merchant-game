                3. Don't be afraid to ask for help. The people of Chandni Chowk are friendly and willing to lend a hand, but they might need a little nudge in the right direction.
                <br/><br/>
                4. Stay sharp and keep your wits about you. The rival merchant is up to something, and he'll do anything to keep you from uncovering his dark secrets!

                As you explore the Red Fort, you notice a faint aroma wafting through the air. It's a delicious smell that reminds you of something familiar, something you've tasted before. You follow the scent to a hidden corner of the fort, where you find a piece of paper with a recipe written on it.
                <br/><br/>
                The recipe is for a popular street food that's famous in Old Delhi. It's a type of stuffed bread that's fried to crispy perfection and served with chutney and pickles. The recipe calls for flour, spices, and a filling made from vegetables, paneer, or meat.
                <br/><br/>
                As you read the recipe, you notice that some of the ingredients are written in a different colour or font. When you write them down, they spell out a secret message:
                <br/><br/>
                "Find me in the narrow alley, where paranthas are the star,
                <br/><br/>
                And spices fill the air with a fragrance that travels far."
                <br/><br/>
                Where should you to go to find next clue?

                Hidden inside one of the plates of delicious parathas is a note that will lead you closer to solving the mystery. But which plate is it? You'll have to use your detective skills to figure it out.

                Ahoy, detective! This is it, the final piece of the puzzle. 
                <br/><br/>
                The rival merchant's shop is where the missing spice merchant's trail went cold. But we suspect foul play! We have reason to believe that something valuable was stolen from the spice merchant's shop and taken to the rival's den. 
                <br/><br/>
                Your task is to infiltrate the rival's shop, snoop around and look for any evidence of theft. 
                <br/><br/>
                Keep your eyes peeled for anything out of place, and don't forget to evaluate thoroughly! 
                <br/><br/>
                Good luck, detective, and may the spices be with you!
